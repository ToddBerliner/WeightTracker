# WeightTracker
This is a simple weight tracking app written in React. Weight and body fat are accepted and every 7 days a new week is produced showing averages and the change in averages from the prior week. The current week is calculated as each day is entered and displayed at the top.

# TODOs

* Learn markdown so this document is formatted!
* Develop a CalendarDB class
  This class would be shared with TimeToEat. The class would be responsible
  for utility functions about dates as well as an internal database of
  calendar days so that history can be shown.
